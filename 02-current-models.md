#Current Models

Currently, we have Mozilla Fellows in the following communities and programs:

* **Knight-Mozilla Open News Fellows** - The Knight-Mozilla Fellowship (run by the [Open News program](https://opennews.org)) places creative technologists in newsrooms to work on open-source tools and support reporting that strengthens the web and changes people’s lives. Knight-Mozilla Fellows work with newsroom technology teams to write open-source code, analyze and visualize data, and explore tough problems facing journalism. [More info](https://opennews.org/what/fellowships/info/).

* **Ford-Mozilla Open Web Fellows** - The Open Web Fellows program — a collaboration between the Ford Foundation and Mozilla — is an international leadership initiative that brings together the best emerging technology talent and civil society organizations to protect the open Web. [More info](https://advocacy.mozilla.org/open-web-fellows/).

* **Mozilla Fellows for Science** - The Mozilla Fellowship for Science, run by the [Mozilla Science Lab](https://mozillascience.org) supports early-career researchers championing open source and open data working within research institutions. [More info](https://mozillascience.org/fellows).

* **Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Fellows** - The Mozilla Developer (MDN) Fellowship intends to accelerate the involvement of highly-skilled and experienced web and mobile developers with the open web. [More info](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/fellowship).

#Commonalities across programs
* The Mozilla Fellowship duration is set to support a Fellow’s learning and leadership experience. 
* Fellowships represents a partnership between Mozilla and our allies in specific communities of practice (e.g advocacy orgs, newsrooms, research institutions).
* Represents an understanding of the dynamics of the system we are aiming to change, which is determined through an iterative approach to shaping the specific Fellowships.
* Mozilla Fellowships have common events that enable Fellows to lead in the Mozilla community and work together as a network.
