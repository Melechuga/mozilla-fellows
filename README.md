# Mozilla Fellows

we’ve been working to better define who a “Mozilla Fellow” is and what they bring to communities we care about.

The Fellowships are part of a larger strategy around leadership development that we’re calling **“Mozilla Learning”**. The focus: **grow a network of leaders furthering web literacy in communities we care about.** You can read more about how that’s taken shape in these posts ([1](https://commonspace.wordpress.com/2015/05/27/mozilla-academy-strategy-update/), [2](https://commonspace.wordpress.com/2015/07/22/building-a-big-tent-for-web-literacy/), [3](https://commonspace.wordpress.com/2015/07/15/web-literacy-and-leadership/)). 

This Gitbook will serve as our main resource on the Mozilla Fellows model, and its various implementations across the organization. Have a question? Feel free to add your question to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/mozillascience/mozilla-fellows/issues) or [drop us an email](kaitlin@mozillafoundation.org).
